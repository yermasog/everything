# The Everything App

One place to track calendar events, organize your list of tasks, store notes and even see the local weather to help you plan for the weekend.

# Application Details

## Purpose
This app was built to mimic the bullet journaling experience. Multiple themes allow for the user to express their personality while taking advantage of the app's simple organization and focus on productivity. 


## Description

This app uses React and multiple React components to allow for seemless transition between various functions. The goal was to build a comprehensive and aesthetically pleasing experience for the user where they can reach a balance between expressing their personality and utilizing productivity and time-management tools such as note-taking, to-do tasks, tracking calendar events and being ready for whatever mother nature may bring their way. We wanted to empower the user to make it through the day by including an inspirational quote every time the app is refreshed.
